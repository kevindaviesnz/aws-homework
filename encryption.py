'''
Perform symetic encryption in order below:
Find library to provide acess to AES256 algorithm
Create and save your AED256 key
Create string to test encryption
Perform AES256 symetric encryption on the data to get ciphir text.
Use AES256 symetri decryption to get original text.
Use assert to check if decrypted data is the same as original text.
